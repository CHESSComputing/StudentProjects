The ChatGPT technology significantly simplify adoptation of complex systems
using natural language capabilities. We would like to explore adoptation
of ChatGPT for [MLHub](https://github.com/vkuznet/MLHub) project.
Users should be able to interact with MLHub via ChatGPT interface.
The project will invovle the following steps:
- add set of ML pre-trained models and their meta-data to MLHub
- add local version of ChatGPT as interface to MLHub
  - train ChatGPT on MLHub data
  - ask ChatGPT to generate ML code for user use-case
  - run user code
  - store it into MLHub
  - access user model or similar to your use-case via ChatGPT interface/API
