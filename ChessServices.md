The CHESS computing leans towards service oriented
infrstracuture, see [Open Science Data
Services](https://wiki.classe.cornell.edu/CHESS/Private/OpenScienceDataServices).
Therefore, we would like to work towards combining various data-services
into uniform web based interface for our users. In order to perform
specific CHESS experiment, an user will come to workstation where
new interface will guide him/her through the process, e.g.:
- how to setup experiment
- how to run workflows, presumably via [CHAP](https://github.com/CHESSComputing/ChessAnalysisPipeline) or [CHAPBook](https://github.com/vkuznet/CHAPaaS)
- how to visualize data (NSDF/CHESS) integration
- how to publish experiment MetaData to
[Chess Data Management service](https://github.com/vkuznet/ChessDataManagement)
- how to publish the data on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)
- how to iterate and reproduce own or somebody else experiment
